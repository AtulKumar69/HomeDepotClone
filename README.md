### Getting Started…


It was a challenging journey for me and all my team members to develop this Site. We all were excited and self-motivated to make this clone as good as the real Homedepot website.


On the night of the first day of construct week, we arranged a Zoom meeting and decided what features will we be adding to the website & also decided our roles & responsibilities.


Communication is a crucial factor for any project and the work has to be done as a team., so we used technologies like slack, WhatsApp, and zoom to know each other's progress. We started our day with a scrum using Zoom at 10:00 in the morning and used WhatsApp for further Work-related queries.
The main tool that we used for collaboration & version control is GitHub Desktop & GitHub Browser. Working on the same page might make some merge errors. So we decided that each and everyone will work on different parts of the project.

### Learning:-


We all became proficient in reading the code of team members.


Our code writing style became cleaner as we had to think while writing code that other team members will be reading.


We had to learn about many CSS properties that we didn’t know before.


Our skills in JavaScript and DOM manipulation became better.


We all learned how to plan a project and execute that.
